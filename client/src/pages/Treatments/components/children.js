          <h1>ABOUT CHILDREN DISEASE</h1>
          <p>Children are more prone to disease, because initially their immune system is not well developed. It is natural to worry when your kid gets fever repeatedly. You may try to keep them bundled up with seasonal cloths for keeping illness at bay. But the truth is that children start getting diseases once the immunity they got from their mother’s milk ends and they need to build their own immune system. Babies or preschools kids usually get 7-8 colds in a year. And this procedure continues until they become teenagers. Apart from cold, your baby may get diarrhea, stomach ache or fever. Viral infections are present everywhere and possibility of getting effected from them is more in kids.</p>

          <h1>CAUSES OF CHILDREN DISEASE</h1>
          <p>As discussed earlier the main cause for children sickness is less immunity. There are hundreds of viruses present in atmosphere. Your child is never exposed to such germs, hence his possibility to catch those virus increases. Usually germs spread from hand to mouth. Kids often take their hands and toys in mouth and thus chances of infection increases.</p>
