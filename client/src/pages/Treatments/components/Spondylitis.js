          <h1>CAUSES OF SPONDYLITIS</h1>
          <p>Cartilage found in our neck is prone to damage which leads to spondylitis. Cause of spondylitis includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bone spur: Overgrowth of bones happens in our body, as these extra bones try to give strength to spine. However, these additional bones exert pressure on spine, resulting in pain</li>
            <li>Dehydrated spinal disks: Spinal bone of our body contains discs, which are like cushion for absorbing jerks due to daily activities like twisting, lifting etc. Gel present in these discs may become dry, thus causes rubbing of bones, which is painful.</li>
            <li>Injury:If you had any injury in the past, like any accidents, it may cause spinal problems in future.</li>
            <li>Overuse: Some jobs involve heavy lifting of weight which causes early damage of spine.</li>
          </ul>
