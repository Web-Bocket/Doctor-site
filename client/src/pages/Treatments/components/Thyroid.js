          <h1>CAUSES OF THYROID</h1>
          <p>Thyroid is mostly caused because of irregular production of thyroid hormones. Excessive production of hormones results in hyperthyroidism, while less production of hormones causes hypothyroidism.</p>
          <p>Hyperthyroidism can be caused because of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Graves’ disease: This results in excessive production of thyroid hormones.</li>
            <li>Toxic Adenomas: This is caused because of development of nodules in thyroid gland which secrete excess hormones, thus disturbing body’s chemical balance.</li>
            <li>Sub-acute Thyroiditis: It is caused because of inflammation in thyroid, thus leaking additional hormones. This results in temporary hyperthyroidism.</li>
          </ul>
