          <h1>CAUSES OF ALLERGY</h1>
          <p>An allergy occurs when our immune system mistakenly considers harmless particles as dangerous invaders. This makes immune system to produce antibiotics for defending body from those invaders. As those particles are harmless, there is no need for a body to produce antibiotics. A patient will be at greater risk of getting allergy because of hereditary. Children are more susceptible to allergens, but as they grow old, this problem will be cured automatically.</p>
