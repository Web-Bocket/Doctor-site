          <h1>CAUSES OF PCOS</h1>
          <p>Causes of PCOS are still unknown, but according to doctors hormonal imbalance and genes can be the reason. Possibility of PCOS increases if a woman’s mother or sister has the same problem. It is believed that overproduction of androgen may be another cause of PCOS. Androgen is a male hormone, but it is also generated in females. Females with PCOS, generate higher level of androgen, thus causing adverse impact on development as well as release of egg at the time of ovulation. Surplus amount of insulin in body may increase androgen level in females.</p>
