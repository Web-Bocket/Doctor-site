          <h1>ABOUT ARTHRITIS</h1>
          <p>If you’re an arthritis sufferer, take a moment and think back to when you were pain free and able to move as desired. With the use of homeopathy, returning to this healthier state is a distinct possibility. If your organism is capable of producing arthritis (or any condition for that matter) given the right conditions, it is also capable of reversing it. The body has an immense capacity for healing. Homeopathic treatment for arthritis taps into this capacity so as to redirect the body’s energies towards the restoration of health.</p>
          <p>In some asthma cases, airways get blocked which stops passing of oxygen into lungs, thus restricting it to enter in blood stream and reach to different parts of the body. Such type of asthma is fatal and patient needs immediate hospitalization.</p>

          <h1>MORE ABOUT ARTHRITIS</h1>
          <p>Arthritis (‘arth’ meaning joint, ‘itis’ meaning inflammation) actually consists of over 100 different conditions: anything from relatively mild forms of tendonitis (aka tennis elbow) and bursitis, to crippling systemic forms such as rheumatoid arthritis. There are pain syndromes like fibromyalgia and arthritis-related disorders, an example of which is systemic lupus erythematosus, a condition that involves every part of the body. And there are also forms of the disease, such as gout, which many people don’t associate with arthritis. There are also other conditions, like osteoarthritis, that many people think is the only form of the disease.</p>
