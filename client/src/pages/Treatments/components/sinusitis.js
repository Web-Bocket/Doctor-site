          <h1>CAUSES OF SINUSITIS</h1>
          <p>Sinus is caused because of viral infection which leads to inflammation in sinuses and mucous membrane. Swelling occurs in mucous membrane due to inflammation, which blocks the drainage of liquid from sinuses into throat and nose. Fluid and liquid present in sinuses leads to pressure and pain. Bacterial growth happens in sinuses in such situations, because of liquid’s inability to drain properly.</p>
          <p>Usually cold also happens in this way, but any infection which causes inflammation in mucous membrane leads to sinusitis.</p>
