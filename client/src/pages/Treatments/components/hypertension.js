          <h1>ABOUT HYPERTENSION</h1>
          <p>Our heart pumps blood which circulates in complete body for supplying oxygen and energy. When blood circulates, it exerts pressure on blood vessels; the force it applies on the vessels is called as blood pressure. In case of high blood pressure also called as hypertension; force applied by blood is too high which has an adverse effect on our heart.</p>
          <p>A person may or may not be aware of hypertension. Untreated high blood pressure may lead to heart attack, other heart problems and stroke. Most of the people suffer from hypertension and if they know about it, it can be controlled easily.</p>
