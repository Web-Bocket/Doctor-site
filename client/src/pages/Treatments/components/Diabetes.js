                    <h1>ABOUT DIABETES</h1>
                    <p>Metabolic disorder in human body because of disturbance in insulin secretion, leads to high sugar level. This condition is called as diabetes.</p>
                    <p>Insulin is a hormone secreted by pancreas and the level of blood sugar is controlled by insulin. In case of sugar in blood, insulin is produced by pancreas which normalizes the level of glucose by promoting absorption of glucose by body cells. In diabetic patient due to insufficient production of insulin, glucose level rises in the body. Homeopathy Treatment for Diabetes is the best solution to control with medications.</p>

                        <li>Diabetes leads to increased amount of sugar level in blood, thus causing loss of glucose through urine. Urine output i.e. frequency of urine will increase which results in dehydration.</li>
                        <li>Frequent urination will increase water consumption in diabetic patient.</li>
                        <li>Deficiency of insulin in body will lead to weight loss.</li>
                        <li>Weight loss in diabetic patient will occur even after following proper diet.</li>

                            <p>The exact reason of getting type 1 diabetes is still not known. It is believed that our body’s immune system destroys the cells which produce insulin in pancreas, thus causing deficiency of insulin and deposition of glucose in bloodstream.</p>
                        </Tab>
                        <Tab eventKey="profile" title="Type-2 Diabetes">
                            <p>In this type of diabetes our cells stop responding to insulin and inability of pancreas to overcome this problem leads to diabetes. Hence instead of going into cells, most of the glucose deposits in bloodstream.</p>

                            <p>At the time of pregnancy, placenta secrets hormones for supporting pregnancy and these hormones increase resistance of cells towards insulin, thus causing diabetes.</p>
